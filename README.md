## Cloning
Clone with `git clone --recursive` to download the snap source as a submodule.

If you've already cloned without `--recursive` do:

* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update`



## Development Getting Started
Once things are setup, use `./run` to launch Rails and start ngrok.

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with `brew` (on a Mac).


## Guidelines

Use the following guides for getting things done, programming well, and
programming in style.

## Requirements and Setup
* Ruby version
	* 2.3.0
* System dependencies
	* Postgres, qt, ngrok
	* `brew install postgres qt`
	* OSX Install postgres:
	```sh
	# To have launchd start postgresql at login:
	ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

	# Then to load postgresql now:
	launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
	```
	* `ngrok` 2 Mac binary is in `bin/`
		* Currently the run script uses `ngrok.yml` with a custom domain.
		* If you don't want to pay, just edit this file.
* Configuration
* Database creation
	* Postgres needs to be running!
	* `rake db:create`
	* `rake db:migrate`
* Database initialization
	* TODO create seeds file
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
