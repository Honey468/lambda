## Cloning
Clone with `git clone --recursive` to download the snap source as a submodule.

If you've already cloned without `--recursive` do:

* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update`

## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].
